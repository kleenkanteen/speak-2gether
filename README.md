# Speak 2gether

Have you ever interrupted someone in a zoom meeting because you thought they finished speaking? Or they interrupted you on accident? I did, and my solution is a visual cue that is easy to control with keyboard shortcuts. 

The teams/zoom way of having to click to raise your hand to queue up is cumbersome. And the visual cue is tiny. Mines is a big red/greend circle indicating if it's your time to speak. You can download it on windows/mac and pin it on top of your windows.
